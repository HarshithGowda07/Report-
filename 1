ABSTRACT
With the increasing demand for high data rates and reliable communication in modern wireless systems, advanced channel coding techniques have become essential. Polar codes, introduced by Erdal Arıkan, are the first class of error-correcting codes proven to achieve channel capacity for symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels. Due to their capacity-achieving property and low-complexity decoding algorithms, polar codes have been adopted in the 5G New Radio (NR) standard for control channel communications.

This project focuses on the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of a Polar Encoder and Decoder, emphasizing Successive Cancellation (SC) and Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding techniques. The work involves understanding the theoretical foundation of channel polarization, frozen and information bit selection, and bit-reversal operations involved in polar encoding. The encoder is implemented using the recursive generator matrix structure, while the decoder is realized using LLR-based SC and SCL algorithms.

Simulation studies are carried out over both noiseless and noisy channels (AWGN) to analyze bit error rate (BER) performance under different signal-to-noise ratio conditions. The project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical realization, providing insights into decoder complexity, latency, and reliability. The outcomes of this work are relevant to defense and communication systems developed at BEL, where robust and efficient error correction is a critical requirement.

INTRODUCTION
Background
Reliable data transmission is a fundamental requirement in digital communication systems, especially in applications involving defense, satellite, and wireless communication. Channel coding plays a vital role in protecting transmitted information against noise and interference. Over the years, several coding schemes such as convolutional codes, Turbo codes, and LDPC codes have been developed to improve communication reliability.

Polar codes represent a major breakthrough in coding theory by achieving channel capacity with low encoding and decoding complexity. The principle of channel polarization transforms a set of identical communication channels into a combination of highly reliable and highly unreliable channels. Information bits are transmitted over reliable channels, while unreliable channels are assigned fixed (frozen) values.

Motivation
Despite their theoretical advantages, the practical implementation of polar decoders—especially list-based decoding—poses challenges related to algorithmic complexity, memory management, and decoding latency. For mission-critical systems such as those developed at BEL, understanding the complete encoder–decoder chain and its performance under realistic channel conditions is essential. This project is motivated by the need to develop a clear, verifiable, and modular implementation of polar encoding and decoding, suitable for both simulation and potential hardware realization.

Relevance
Polar codes are already standardized in 5G and are of growing interest in defense and aerospace communication systems. The project aligns well with industrial requirements, providing hands-on exposure to modern coding techniques, decoder algorithms, and system-level performance evaluation.

PROBLEM DEFINITION
The primary challenge addressed in this project is the accurate implementation and validation of polar encoding and decoding algorithms for finite block lengths under practical channel conditions. While theoretical descriptions of polar codes exist, incorrect handling of bit-reversal ordering, frozen-bit selection, and decoding recursion can lead to performance degradation or incorrect decoding.

The project aims to design a fully functional Polar Encoder and Decoder that correctly follows polar code construction rules and decoding logic. Both SC and SCL decoding are analyzed to study the trade-off between decoding complexity and error-rate performance. The system is evaluated under noiseless and noisy channels to ensure correctness and robustness.
